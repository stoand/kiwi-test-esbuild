# TODOs

0. [WIP] Every individual `_I` annotation should use a file index instead of the full file path to save space
1. [WIP] The js_printer should accumulate a list of all instrumented ranges and save these at the end.
    This will enable the inference of what block/expr were not called
2. [WIP] Copy over the test runtime
3. [WIP] Calculation of what lines were affected by failing or succeeding tests
4. [WIP] Kakoune test listing
5. [WIP] Console.log
6. [WIP] Open console, error output as seperate files
    Also use a diff library and syntax highlighting
